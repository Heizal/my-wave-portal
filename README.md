# [Wave Portal](https://waveportal-starter-project.heizalnagginda.repl.co/)
This is project demonstrates my learning process in Solidity. For this project I have built a Web3 app using Solidity, Reactjs and Ethereum Smart Contracts. It's a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who me and send me a ðŸ‘‹ + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract.

## Languages used
<ul>
  <li>Solidity</li>
  <li>Reactjs for the Frontend</li>
</ul>

## Lessons learn't
<ul>
  <li>How to intiate a set up and deploy a smart contract using Solidity and Hardhat</li>
  <li>How to link a metamask wallet to my smart contract</li>
  <li>How to interact and build a UI for my Web3 app using Reactjs</li>
  <li>How to look at the state of my smart contract address using Etherscan</li>
</ul>

# To run the project.
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
